                    I am an extremely passionate self taught aspiring developer. My superpower is my background in
                    Geology. Geology has given me the ability to tackle and not shy away from complex/obscure problems
                    that are unfamiliar to me, and figure out what it takes to solve them. I want to take this course to
                    learn more about Javascript and better position myself for the job market in the Memphis area. At
                    the beginning of Covid-19 I was working as a Geologist for the Navy and found myself forced to work
                    from home. Due to the sensitive nature of my work I couldn't bring any of my work home with me and
                    had to stay busy somehow, I decided to learn how to code since I already did a bit of bash scripting
                    and linux database stuff at work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found myself learning more about linux/bash scripting as well as C programming, and then finally
                    ended up learning about Web Development. I was immediately hooked when I started learning about
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided I wanted to do whatever it took to learn what I needed to make
                    a career transition into web development, and moved back to the Memphis area to focus on learning
                    and be closer to family.
